I used bit manuplation and bit masking for solving this problem. If there is no zero pattern between 1's, program returns -1. Otherwise program looks the max 0's
with using previous and current indices. Another solution may be using two indices without bit manuplation but convert to binary value and put in list and track 0's 
in this list.
