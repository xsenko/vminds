docker-compose file have zookeeper and one broker configuration,
you can run directly docker-compose up
I defined 2 port one is for docker network (9092), other is accepting outside connections with 9093.
There is no SSL or security configuration, broker accepts every request.
Again there is no security config on zookeper, allow_anon_login = yes configured.

I write simple Producer and Consumer, you can run producer then consumer with java -jar
